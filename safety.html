<h class="right">Basic safety protocol
  Risk management is the way hazardous situations are handled.
  Worker Protection: Health standards, often in the form of permissible exposure limits or performance standards, limit the duration and/or level of exposure to hazardous substances or set the health or performance levels that workers need to maintain. For example, OSHA issues permissible exposure limits that set regulatory limits on hazardous exposures for a wide range of workplaces and industries
  Fitness standards
  Fitness-for-duty standards—These standards provide a “minimum measurable capability or capacity” for the specific parameter (e.g., aerobic capacity) based in some cases on normative values for age and sex for the general population
  Exposure limits: Space permissible exposure limits—These types of standards set ceilings on risk exposures during missions and are based on measures of exposure to a physical or chemical agent (e.g., radiation) with quantifiable limits over a given amount of time (e.g., lifetime radiation exposure)
  NASA has developed standards that specify health-related criteria for astronaut selection and parameters for health and medical screening, evaluation, and certification including annual certification medical examination.
  Long duration spaceflight physicals with requirements to meet a number of criteria, including distance and near visual acuity correctable to 20/20 in each eye (refractive surgical procedures of the eye are allowed, “providing at least 1 year has passed since the date of the procedure with no permanent adverse after effects”), blood pressure below 140/90 in a sitting position, and specific height requirements.
